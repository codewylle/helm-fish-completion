* Usage

You can invoke Helm Fish completion with the ~helm-fish-completion~ command.

To replace completion in Eshell and =M-x shell=, simply rebind the TAB key:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (require 'helm-fish-completion nil 'noerror)
  (define-key shell-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'helm-fish-completion)
  (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'helm-fish-completion-set-keys))
#+end_src

~fish-completion-mode~ is not needed.
